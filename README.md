# Property_Management_Java

## Overview
This simple Java application is designed for a property management company. 
The company manages individual properties for rent, charging a management fee based on a percentage of the monthly rental amount. 
Each property must be within the company's plot limits and cannot overlap. The application allows users to create a management company and add properties to its list. 
It's worth noting that this application has a maximum limit of 5 properties per company.

## Key Features
**Aggregation:** The application demonstrates the concept of aggregation by managing properties as part of a property management company.

**Passing Object to Method:** Objects, such as properties, are passed to methods to perform various operations.

**Array Structure:** The program uses arrays to store and manage properties efficiently.

**Objects as Elements of the Array:** Each element in the property list array is an object representing a managed property.

**Processing Array Elements:** The application performs operations on property objects within the array.

**Copy Constructor:**  It includes a copy constructor to duplicate property objects efficiently.

**JUnit Testing:**  The code includes JUnit tests to ensure the correctness of the application's functionality.

## Usage
  *Create a Management Company:
  *Extract the whole src file and run it in your IDE **NOTE** JAVA FX is needed to run the GUI
  *Follow the prompts to create a property management company.

**Add Properties:**

After creating the management company, you can add up to 5 properties.
Follow the prompts to input property details, including name, rental amount, and coordinates.
## View and Manage Properties:
 * Once properties are added, you can view and manage them through the application.
   
Dependencies
Java Development Kit (JDK)
JUnit (for testing)

# Important Notes
* This basic demonstration application needs to cover real-world property management complexities.
* Please ensure the input property coordinates do not overlap with existing properties or exceed the company's plot limits.

## Credits
This project was created to practice Java programming concepts and is not intended for actual property management use.
